Adam wakes up in the morning.
He brushes his teeth.
He has breakfast.
He takes a bath.
Then he checked Instagram.
He goes to class.
Adam dies.
 
 Sufyan
Adam resurrects.
Adam regains his might.
He gained devastating sights of the future,
in which everything is destroyed.
He gains composure.
    He is enlightened,
